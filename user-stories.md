Cal, a person who works in the office all day, wanted a change of scenery after work. He would like to go home and take his dog on a walk in a space he hasn't been to before. He thought it would be nice to see a list of public spaces where he can filter through amenities and see if it is pet friendly and near his apartment. He goes to the SFPOPOS site on his desktop before heading out and clicks the pet friendly and neightborhood filters and found a public space that's close by!

Lex, who lives in Vallejo and commutes to the city everyday, wanted to find a space where he could relax and let the traffic pass before he headed back home. He would like to find a space that is near a freeway entrance and has a coffee shop maybe half a mile away. He opens the app on his phone and filters through the list until he found one nearby. He clicked the one that he liked and saw that there was a coffee shop nearby.   

Syd, a student at USF, stated that the weather has been so nice lately after all of this rain, so she was hoping to find a spot to eat her lunch and do some work thatâ€™s near campus or even one that is close to a muni stop as Bart is far from campus. She opens the site on her desktop and goes through the filters to find a space near the bus stop and one with picnic tables and found one nearby. She clicked the space and was taken to another page where she saw a map and features the space had to offer.
